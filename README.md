# Supporting information for _Charge compensation during amyloid formation of alpha-synuclein_

This repository contains electronic notebooks for reproducing the simulation results presented
in the above manuscript.

Each of the three folders below contains simulations of alpha-synuclein as a monomer and as a decamer
for the (1) the wildtype and for (2) a mutant. The salt concentrations can be 0 mM or 15 mM as indicated.
Also, in each folder you will find Jupyter notebooks for either running Monte Carlo simulations and for
simply plotting and analysing. You will most likely want to run the latter as running all simulations
is a lengthy procedure.

- `wildtype-0mM/`
- `wildtype-15mM/`
- `mutant_5Q-0mM/`

In addition to simulations, the folder `extract-nmr-data` contains a notebook for extracting
data from a previously published experimental work.
